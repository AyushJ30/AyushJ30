# 👋 Hey there! I'm Ayush

I'm a recent Computer Science graduate passionate about building interactive and meaningful digital experiences. I’m currently working on an indie **2D adventure RPG game** using **Unity and C#**, where I bring pixel worlds to life with gameplay mechanics, exploration, and combat systems.

Beyond game dev, I’m expanding into the world of **AI and data science** — combining creativity with analytics to solve real-world problems.

### 🎮 Currently Working On

I'm developing a **2D Adventure RPG** in **Unity** — blending storytelling, exploration, and combat mechanics in a handcrafted pixel-art world.

🛠️ Features I’m building:
- Sprite animations and tilemaps
- Dialogue and quest systems
- Inventory and XP leveling
- Custom combat design
- Ambience and game sound systems

Stay tuned! Dev logs and sneak peeks coming soon.

### 📊 Data Science & ML Projects

As part of learning **AI and data science**, I’ve completed hands-on projects using **Python**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn**:

- 🔹 [**Sea Level Predictor**](https://github.com/AyushJ30/Sea-Level-Predictor): Predicts future sea levels using linear regression on EPA climate data. Clean visuals and regression lines show climate trends till 2050.

- 🔹 [**Page View Time Series Visualizer**](https://github.com/AyushJ30/Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer): Analyzes web traffic over time using matplotlib/seaborn to uncover trends, seasonality, and outliers.

- 🔹 [**Medical Data Visualizer**](https://github.com/AyushJ30/Medical-Data-Visualizer): Explores patient health data using box plots and heatmaps to visualize cardiovascular risk factors.

### 🌿 Applied Machine Learning for Sustainability

🧠 [**Prevention of Air Pollution by Predictive Planting of Trees**](https://github.com/AyushJ30/Prevention-of-Air-Polllution-by-Predictive-Planting-of-Trees)

A project close to my heart — using **Random Forest Regression** to recommend the best tree species and locations to reduce air pollution, based on pollutant absorption, tree height, and geography.

> 🌳 Turning machine learning into environmental impact — one tree at a time.
